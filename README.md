hybrid capture in mimosoid/Caesalpinioid legumes

The file mimobaits_phylotargets_Albizia964_cds.fasta contains coding sequences of the 964 low-copy nuclear genes that are described by Koenen et al. (submitted) "Hybrid capture of 964 nuclear genes resolves generic-level evolutionary relationships in the mimosoid clade (Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae) and reveals a putative hard polytomy that spawned a large pantropical radiation".

The file mimobaits_v1_AlbiziaInga1387targets_cds.fasta contains 1387 genes based on Albizia and Inga transcriptomes, which includes both the 964 low-copy nuclear genes mentioned above, the genes used in the study on the genus Inga by Nicholls et al. (2015) "Using targeted enrichment of nuclear genes to increase phylogenetic resolution in the neotropical rain forest genus Inga (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae)" Frontiers in Plant Science https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2015.00710, as well as some additional "functional" genes that have not been analyzed yet.

The file mimobaits_v2_Albizia997targets_cds.fasta contains 997 genes included in a redesign of the baits that we are currently using in the Hughes lab at the University of Zurich.
