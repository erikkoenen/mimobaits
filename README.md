hybrid capture in mimosoid/Caesalpinioid legumes

The file mimobaits_phylotargets_Albizia964_cds.fasta contains coding sequences of the 964 low-copy nuclear genes that are described by Koenen et al. (submitted) "Hybrid capture of 964 nuclear genes resolves generic-level evolutionary relationships in the mimosoid clade (Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae) and reveals a putative hard polytomy that spawned a large pantropical radiation".

The file mimobaits_v2_Albizia997targets_cds.fasta contains the 997 genes included in a redesign of the baits that we are currently using in the Hughes lab at the University of Zurich.

More info soon.
